# MaainHome CCC — Cloud Control Center

Central admin dashboard for managing MaainHome kiosk devices.

**Live URL:** https://maainhome-ccc.vercel.app  
**Last Updated:** 2026-06-06 (Git Config Update)

## What Is This

CCC (Cloud Control Center) is the admin panel used to:
- Approve new kiosk devices before they go live
- Monitor device status (pending / approved / disabled)
- Transfer devices between users
- Manage payment expiry and subscription
- Force re-register devices that have been moved to new clients

---

## Current Registration Flow

```
Kiosk boots → reads UUID from /home/maainhome/.uuid
           → reads PIN from /home/maainhome/.env
           → POST /api/register  (uuid + pin)
           → shows "Station Pending Approval" on screen
           → polls GET /api/status?uuid=... every 10s

Admin opens CCC → sees device in Pending table
              → clicks Approve → enters PIN shown on kiosk screen
              → Firestore: status = "approved", secure_key generated

Kiosk detects "approved" → auto-pairs with new secure_key
                        → shows "Waiting for Connection"
```

## Disable vs Remove

| Action | Firestore Record | Kiosk Shows | Recoverable | Use When |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Disable** | Kept (`status: disabled`) | "Access Revoked" | Yes — re-approve | Payment expired, temp block |
| **Remove** | Deleted | "Station Pending Approval" | Yes — re-register | Transfer to new user, factory reset |

> **Always prefer Disable** over Remove unless transferring to a new user.

---

## Device Release / Transfer Process

When transferring a device to a new client:
1. Click **Remove** on the device in CCC
2. Wait ~30 seconds — the kiosk will auto-register and appear in **Pending**
3. Click **Approve** from the Pending list (no manual UUID entry — prevents typos)
4. Update `user_id` to the new client's Firebase UID

> ⚠️ Do NOT use Quick Approve for transfers — it requires manual UUID entry and risks typos.

## Architecture

- **Backend:** Go serverless functions on Vercel (`api/` folder)

- **Frontend:** Static HTML/CSS/JS served by Vercel
- **Auth:** No CCC admin auth currently — open dashboard (add login before multi-admin)
